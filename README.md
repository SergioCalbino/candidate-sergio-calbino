# Khemlabs Developer Skills Assessment

We all know that nowadays we can use stackoverflow and chat-gpt to do part of our work. And although that will be welcome on a day-to-day basis, this exam is designed so that we can understand if your level and knowledge match a "Junior" profile, for this reason it should not be necessary for you to access these tools at any time.

## Environment requirements

- node >= 18
- yarn _(you can use NPM if you want, but as the project was created with yarn we encourage you to use it)_

## Example

If you run "npm run example" or "yarn example" and go to [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/) you will see an example of the final work, **YOU DO NOT NEED** to copy the styling or code, it's just there so you can check that all the functionalities are present in your version.

## Objective

Evaluate the knowledge and proficiency of a junior developer in React, TypeScript, React state management, and version control manager

## Instructions

- Clone this repository
- Create your own branch named **candidate/your-name**
- Complete the exercise below by following the requirements and guidelines provided
- Commit your code and push it to your own branch

### Exercise

Create a simple task management application using React and TypeScript. The application should allow users to add, update, and delete tasks. You can use any open source library or component of your choice.

#### Requirements

- Use React and TypeScript to build the application.
- Use the npm ecosystem to manage dependencies.
- Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

#### Desired

- Apply best practices in code organization and maintainability.
- Include appropriate validation and error handling.
- Style it using tailwind

#### Extra

- Implement state management using Redux

### Guidelines
